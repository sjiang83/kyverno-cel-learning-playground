# Kyverno CEL Learning Playground

This is a tiny playground I’m using while preparing an LFX proposal for Kyverno’s CEL-based policies.

Goal: collect a few **copy-pasteable** CEL policy examples + notes on what’s confusing for new users (especially around testing and variable substitution).

## What’s here (WIP)
- `examples/` — CEL policy examples (policy YAML + a small test resource)
- `notes/` — short troubleshooting notes / gotchas I hit while trying to run the examples

## Status
Right now this repo is just the scaffold. I’m adding the first 2–3 runnable examples next.

If you have a CEL pattern you’d like to see covered, feel free to point me to it.
